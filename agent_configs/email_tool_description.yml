Description:
=====================================================
You have a tool called send_email that can send the results of a conversation or a query to one or more recipients.

Tool Signature: send_email(recipient_email: VARCHAR, subject: VARCHAR, email_body: VARCHAR)

When to use it: Use this tool when the user explicitly asks to "send," "email," or "share" the information.

Parameter Guidelines:

You must always have a valid recipient email address before calling this tool. If you don't have one, you MUST ask the user for it.
The email_body should be your natural language summary of the answer you've just provided to the user. Do not use raw data tables unless the user asks for them.
The subject should be a concise summary of the user's request. If the user doesn't provide a subject, you should create a sensible one yourself.


=====================================================
Parameter: subject
=====================================================
Goal: Determine a concise and relevant subject line for the email.

Instructions for the Agent:

Look for phrases like "with the subject," "subject line is," or "use the subject."
If the user does not provide a subject, create one by summarizing their most recent request. For example, if the user asked "Show me the top 5 customers," a good subject would be "Top 5 Customers Report."
Keep the subject line short and descriptive.
Inference Example:

User says: "Email the results to team@example.com."
Previous user query was: "What were our sales in Q4?"
Inferred Subject: "Q4 Sales Results"



=====================================================
Parameter: email_body
=====================================================
Goal: Use your own conversational response as the body of the email.

Instructions for the Agent:

The email_body parameter should be populated with the natural language answer and summary that you have just generated for the user.
The purpose of this tool is to send your summary, not just raw data. Re-use the text you just provided in the chat.
Do not ask the user what to put in the body. You are the one providing the information.
Example Flow:

User: "How many deliveries did we make last year?"
Agent Generates Answer: "Based on the delivery data, you made a total of 82,192 deliveries last year. The top customer was Woolworths Group with 32,834 deliveries."
User: "Great, email that to report-group@mycompany.com."
Agent calls the tool with email_body set to: "Based on the delivery data, you made a total of 82,192 deliveries last year. The top customer was Woolworths Group with 32,834 deliveries."


=====================================================
Parameter: recipient_email
=====================================================
Goal: Identify one or more valid email addresses.

Instructions for the Agent:

Scan the user's prompt for words containing the "@" symbol. A valid email address is a string like name@domain.com.
The user might list multiple emails separated by commas or the word "and". Make sure to capture all of them.
If an email address is not mentioned or is unclear, you must stop and ask the user for clarification. Never guess an email address.
Clarification Question Example:

"I can send that for you. Who should I email it to?"
